      "chapter_1_title": "Introduction: My Path in Programming",
      "chapter_1_text_1": "It all started in 2023 when I was 13 years old. I was in 7th grade and first encountered programming. My first task was to create a website using HTML and CSS â€” it was a homework assignment for informatics. On the 'New Knowledge' platform (nz.ua), I saw this task, although I had never done anything like it before. I carefully read the instructions, watched YouTube tutorials, and began learning the structure of an HTML file and basic CSS styles.",
      "chapter_1_text_2": "It was already 11 PM, but I decided to get to work. I didnâ€™t have proper tools: I was working on a weak school Chromebook, which couldnâ€™t even install Windows due to school restrictions. As a code editor, I used a simple text editor called Text. It had no syntax highlighting or extensions â€” just line numbering. Despite this, I started writing code and finished my first website by 4 AM. I didnâ€™t even notice how time flew by! Thatâ€™s when I first experienced real project development.",
      "chapter_2_title": "Chapter 1: A New Laptop and First Steps",
      "chapter_2_text_1": "Seven months later, in 2023, my dad brought home an old HP Pavilion dv6 laptop from 2011, given to him by a friend. It was a mid-budget laptop with a Pentium B940 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and two graphics cards: an integrated HD2000 and a discrete Radeon HD 6490M. Since I was the only one in the family who knew a bit about computers, the laptop became mine. It had no operating system, so I decided to install Windows 7, as some drivers didnâ€™t support Windows 10.",
      "chapter_2_text_2": "I asked my older brother to burn Windows 7 onto a USB drive, after which I installed the system and started using the laptop. Before that, I was already interested in hardware and knew how computers worked. I first used a personal computer in 2016. It was my parentsâ€™ old Acer laptop with a Pentium processor (I donâ€™t remember the exact model). On it, I played Need for Speed: Most Wanted 2005 and spent hours trying to beat the first boss, Sonny. My mom didnâ€™t like that I spent so much time on the laptop and often banned me from using it.",
      "chapter_3_title": "Chapter 2: First Experiments and Discoveries",
      "chapter_3_text_1": "Later, I started experimenting. One time, I installed Roblox on my parentsâ€™ Acer laptop but carefully hid it from them. I deleted the desktop shortcut and removed the Roblox and Roblox Studio folders from the Start menu. However, I didnâ€™t know how to remove the program from the list in Windows settings. So, I entered my first Google search: 'How to remove a program from the list of programs in Windows?' Thatâ€™s how I learned about the registry and the regedit editor.",
      "chapter_3_text_2": "That moment was a revelation for me: I realized thereâ€™s much more to a computerâ€™s simple interface than what regular users, who only need a browser, see. I started exploring how everything works, and when my mom found out, she gave me more time for experiments. Thatâ€™s when I realized I truly enjoyed it.",
      "chapter_4_title": "Chapter 3: Returning to Programming",
      "chapter_4_text_1": "Back in 2023, I decided to try my hand at being a programmer. I loved creating something new, and I decided programming was my thing. In 7th grade, I started learning the basics: first, I figured out where and what is used, then I tried different areas. But time was critically short: I woke up at 9 AM, classes lasted until 2 PM, and then there was a lot of homework.",
      "chapter_4_text_2": "In 2024, I decided to focus solely on informatics. Classes were held remotely via Google Meet, and I put my phone aside to read programming books. I decided to study web development until I found something that truly interested me. Along the way, I learned about the Open Source movement, Git, GitHub, IDEs, and other important terms.",
      "chapter_5_title": "Chapter 4: Getting to Know Linux",
      "chapter_5_text_1": "One day, I decided to try one of the greatest Open Source inventions â€” Linux. My friend Mykyta Agashkov and I were chatting on Discord, and I suggested an experiment: switch to Linux for 2 weeks. Mykyta agreed and proposed a bet: if I reinstalled Windows even once, heâ€™d win 100 UAH. I burned an Ubuntu 24.04 distro image onto a USB, but the installer only supported UEFI, which my old laptop didnâ€™t support. So, I chose Ubuntu 22.04 and successfully installed it. After that, I encountered the unfamiliar GNOME environment: a top panel, a huge app menu instead of a compact Start menu â€” it reminded me of macOS. I decided to explore alternatives like KDE, XFCE, LXDE, and others, and I especially liked KDE. However, Ubuntu wasnâ€™t optimized for changing desktop environments, and installing KDE failed. Still, I decided to give GNOME a chance and get used to it, but after 4 days, I realized it wasnâ€™t comfortable.",
      "chapter_5_text_2": "During those 4 days, I needed some Windows programs, so I installed Wine â€” a compatibility layer for running Windows apps on Linux. Version 4.0, stable for Ubuntu 22.04, was outdated (Wineâ€™s website already had version 9.2). Some programs didnâ€™t run, so I decided to try a rolling-release distro, where all programs are updated to the latest versions.",
      "chapter_5_text_3": "My choice was Arch Linux. Many consider its installation complex due to the lack of a graphical interface, but for me, it was easier than expected. After a week of setup, I installed the KDE desktop environment and necessary programs: Firefox, Steam, Spotify, Telegram, and Wine 9.3. I needed Photoshop CS6 to create icons for a project, but Adobe doesnâ€™t support Linux. Using Wine, I ran Photoshop, and it worked perfectly.",
      "chapter_6_title": "Chapter 5: My First Serious Project",
      "chapter_6_text_1": "Around the same time, I installed my first IDE â€” Visual Studio Code, which I still use, and GitHub Desktop for working with Git. Thatâ€™s when I started my first serious project, which is still on GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/ChosenSoull/MasterSwordOnline\">link</a>. I created it to test what I had learned over the year â€” from 2023 to 2024.",
      "chapter_6_text_2": "The project was experimental: I coded 15 hours a day for 30 days. But over time, it became hard to develop and maintain. I realized I did everything wrong: I should have planned the projectâ€™s architecture first, defined what I wanted from it, and how to implement certain features. In the end, I paused the project and started studying where I went wrong.",
      "chapter_7_title": "Conclusion: My Results and Plans",
      "chapter_7_text_1": "Over time, I realized what I want to do â€” low-level programming in C/C++: developing microcontrollers for computers and various low-level systems. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t study other frameworks like Vue or Angular â€” React is enough for me.",
      "chapter_7_text_2": "Thank you for reading my informatics homework and my story about how I found my passion!
